# Devcontainer for PySPEDAS

## What is this?
This is a devcontainer environment for [PySPEDAS](https://github.com/spedas/pyspedas) that works on GitHub codespaces.  
All you need is a GitHub account and a modern web browser! Everything else will be automatically installed.  
It should be a nice platform for new users (such as students) to start with and perhaps for hands-on sessions.

## How to start
You can click on "Code" and select "Codespaces" tab, and then go to "Create codespace on main" (see the image blow).

<div align="center">

</div>

After a while, VSCode will launch on the web browser. Now you can do whatever you want on a jupyter notebook.

## Samples
Currently, `sample` directory contains examples for ERG and MMS.

## Warning
Since there is limitation on computing resources available on GitHub codespaces, this is probably not a right choice for everyday use.
See, [the official information](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces) for detail.
